                    <p>Advanced technologies have transformed how accounting professionals handle data, making accounting increasingly a STEM-related field that requires strong data analytics and technology skills. This case study gives students hands-on experience using SQL and Tableau to perform real-world data analysis. It covers tasks like data extraction with SQL, data visualization using word clouds, geographic maps, and boxplots, data grouping through clustering, and communicating insights via interactive dashboards and storytelling. The goal is to help students appreciate how SQL and Tableau can be powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing large datasets, while developing a strong data analytics mindset.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>Dillard's, Inc. is a luxury department store chain headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, founded in 1938 by William T. Dillard. It expanded rapidly through acquisitions in the 1960s and became a public company in 1969. Today, it operates about 282 stores across 29 states, with Texas (57) and Florida (42) having the most locations, all still under family control.</p>
                    
                    <p>The company has long collected daily transaction data from all stores. The CEO has tasked the cosmetics department manager with preparing a performance report analyzing key metrics — total sales, discount rate, profit margin, sales growth rate, and return rate — and to suggest one additional analysis. Using Microsoft SQL Server, the goal is to provide an insightful review of the Christmas season to help enhance the company's holiday sales strategy.</p>

                    <p>Students learned SQL basics and Tableau for data analysis. In week 11, they started the Dillard's case as a final individual project, submitted and presented in week 13. Pre- and post-tests showed clear improvement in SQL and Tableau skills. The case helps assess analytical abilities and can be used as a final or in-class project.</p>

                            <li>Arkansas often offered the lowest average discount rates (3.3%) in December 2015, but their average profit margin is relatively low at 15.5%. In comparison, the average discount rate of stores in Ohio is 6.6% in the same month, but their average profit margin is 34.5%.

It reveals that the majority of states meet the target of 5% excluding Iowa, with fluctuations mostly ranging between 0.7% and 3.7%. However, on Thursdays and Fridays, the discount rates are notably higher with a wider dispersion.</p>

It is interesting to note that despite the significantly higher discount rates offered on Thursdays and Fridays, it did not result in higher sales on Thursdays. Surprisingly, the sales on Saturdays are noticeably higher with lower discount rates. Moreover, there seems to be no apparent cause-and-effect relationship between discount rates and total sales.</p>
                        <p>While many stores offer higher discounts on Thursdays, sales on these days are usually lower than on Fridays and Saturdays. This may be due to a higher volume of customers on Saturday.

                            <li><strong>Cluster 1: Profit Winners</strong> - are highly profitable but experience low sales. To attract new customers, our company could consider offering discounts or providing free samples of these products.

                            <li><strong>Cluster 2: Sales winners</strong> - are the most popular brands. To further capitalize on their popularity, our company can strategically place these products in prominent store locations or feature them prominently on the cosmetic products' webpage to attract a larger customer base. Given the mid-level profit margin, instead of offering discounts, our company could consider providing more generous gifts to incentivize purchases.</li>
                            <li>We can also conduct cluster analysis to analyze customers' behaviors. We can better understand the demands of different groups of customers to provide customized services.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Since we only have partial data for October 2016 and missing data for November and December 2016, we can only compare the sales growth rate between January and October for 2015 and 2016. We observed that sales generally decreased from January to August in both 2015 and 2016.</li>
                            <li>The sales growth rates dropped sharply in March and August 2015, but not in 2016. These two declines in 2015 followed sales increases in February and June. The drops may have been caused by the cessation of promotional activities offered in February and June 2015. This issue appears to have been addressed in 2016.</li>
                            <li>Based on the sales growth rates for 2015 and 2016, we can predict that the sales growth rate for February 2017 may be close to 20%.</li>
                            <li>The line chart is especially good at discovering trends.</li>
                            <li>We can apply trend analysis to examine the trends in sales volume, profit growth, and other financial data.</li>
                            <li>We can use the word cloud to compare the sales growth rates of different brands. Additionally, we can use the geographic map to compare the sales growth rate of different states.</li>

                        <p>Dillard's cosmetic products' return rates are lower than the industry average in most months, excluding January. This is better than expected. The higher return rates in January are understandable, as it follows Christmas and many customers may need to return or exchange gifts.</p>
                        <p>The return rates remain stable, ranging from 3% to 4% between February and October. However, as the discount and holiday seasons arrive, the return rates increase and then drop again in February.</p>

                        <p>The dashboard analysis for Texas, utilizing the geographic map as a filter. The most popular cosmetic brands in Texas are Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome, Mac, and Chanel for Women. Notably, Chanel for Women boasts a higher profit margin compared to other popular brands, and Estee Lauder is particularly favored in Texas. Texas stores often offer substantial discounts on Fridays, with rates about three times higher than the average discount rate. Previous analysis indicates that sales are likely to stay at a similar level on Fridays, despite the stores offering greater discounts on that day. This implies that providing larger discounts may not significantly boost sales but could potentially impact customers' perception of product pricing.</p>
                        <p>As a result, our company may want to consider implementing other promotional strategies instead of relying solely on low discount offers. By exploring alternative approaches, we can maintain customers' confidence in product pricing while finding effective ways to drive sales and enhance overall customer satisfaction.</p>
